* render it also via a color module

if foo -> {kw:if} {ident:foo} {scope}
end

if foo: -> {kw:if} {ident:foo} {scope}

* ASTs are styled with css
* lexicon is colored via color modules
* elastic tabs are when columns align in monospace form

int x = 1;   // X is a thing
int y = 3;   // Y is a thing
int foo = 4; // This should be lined up...
int b = 77;  // ...with this line

* whenever a space is added, all comments are pushed over equally. They are lined up on export.

* tab creates scopes? How much do we automatically do?
* Let's experiment with both! :)

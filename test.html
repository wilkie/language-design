The art of programming was first imagined by Ada Lovelace as she worked alongside engineer Charles Babbage to develop the predecessor of the modern computer: The Analytical Machine. Eventually, the practice of programming was pioneered and refined by a group of women working during World War II on the Mark I and ENIAC computers. The effort of talking to computers was difficult and laborious. Grace Hopper, inspired by Betty Snyder before her, invented the compiler and unveiled it to the skeptical male community of her time. The idea of writing code in "plain English," as she would put it, was thought beyond the capability of computation. Only humans could translate ideas into machine code was the prevailing and, with benefit of hindsight, naive point of view.

However, throughout the years, computers were indeed too feeble to handle the plethora of typesetting options available in print. Basic printers and basic terminals were all that you could hope for in the early 60s when compilers were becoming dominant. Technical limitations made the grid-based layout of code and the use of monospace text the norm. Today, monospace typesetting for code is the expected and indeed cherished form of writing code.

Programmers today enjoy a celebration of individual merit and refined skill. Albeit, programming has not been proven to be an inherent ability. In fact, computers are a rather new invention, although the concept of an algorithm dates back to a time of Ottoman enlightenment that we tend to pretend didn't happen. What it comes down to is that algorithms are a generalization of process. It seems clear that individuals can handle a series of steps and that they can handle writing a program. Certainly, a painter has a process. A composer writes algorithms in the form of music, not specifically for machines but rather for musicians, and they also benefit from a lifetime of refinement and skill. It all seems the same when you allow yourself the proper perspective.

With this in mind, perhaps our love for monospace is, in reality, our love of imposed individuality and culture. If that is true, we are certainly at fault for many of our cultural failings. We should at the very least open ourselves to change. Experimentation and imagination cannot be so expendable. Therefore, let's attempt to rid ourselves of our monospace mentality. We have hundreds of years of typography to learn from!
